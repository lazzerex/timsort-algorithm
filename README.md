#TimSort Algorithm
- Timsort is a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines the strengths of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort. It's used as the default sorting algorithm in Python and Java's standard libraries, and it's known for its efficiency on real-world data. This Timsort implementation first uses Insertion Sort on small subarrays, then merges these sorted subarrays using Merge Sort. The combination of these two algorithms results in an efficient sorting method that performs well on real-world data with various distributions.
- The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n log n)
